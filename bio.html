          <br />Professional Summary</h3>
        <p>As an office assistant at a start-up, I have worn many hats. I have
          done reception work, customer service, dabbled in HR & marketing, and spent
          much of my time in facilities. I am now turning to pursue project management
          as I very much enjoy the planning and executing of a project. I am goal
          oriented and wish to put forth great results.

        <p>My time at Heptio has lead me down to the path of project managemnet and
          coding. I began classes at Edmonds Community College (EdCC) for a project
          management certificate in summer 2018. I will recieve my certificate in
          March 2019. As of January 2019, I am in the front-end web development
          certificate program at University of Washington (UW). I am ecstatic to
          continue this journey and see where it leads me.</p>
