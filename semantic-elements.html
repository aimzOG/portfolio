    <h1>get with the program: my coding adventure</h1>
    <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
    <p>My name is Aimee and I think it would be fun to learn something about me
      through a game: Two Truths and a Lie. So, which one do you believe is
      untrue about me? Scroll to the bottom to see if you were right!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I ate dried chapulines (grasshoppers) in Mexico</li>
      <li>I smoked my first cigarette in Thailand (I know. I know.)</li>
      <li>I met the lead singer of a legendary punk rock band in Prague</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'm so excited to start coding. Two year ago, in conversation, I said to
      my CTO, "I'd never be able to do that; It's <em>way</em> over my head!"
      The world took that as a challenge and here we are! <strong><em>Never</em>
      </strong> say never.
    </p>
    <p>I joined this UW front-end program for multiple reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I wanted to supplement my project management certificate (recieving it
         in March) so that I can better collaborate with devs in the future- or
         <em>become</em> one.</li>
      <li>FOMO. My boyfriend's a dev; our best friend's a dev; most of my
        coworkers are devs; I want to know
        what the heck they're all talking about.</li>
      <li>I finally get to engage the creative side of my brain- it could use some
        work but it's there!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Jumping into Lesson 01- What is a semantic element?</h3>
    <p>To be semantic is to have meaning. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> itself is not
       semantic because it’s not descriptive- what contents is it holding? Is it
       a heading? A footer? A section? We don’t know just by reading <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
       and would have to give each one a class. So, HTML5 has made it easier for
       both the browser and developer to understand what the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
       is by naming it according to what would normally be the given class. Example,
       down below you'll see my answer to the game. I used <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>
       which is the specified name of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
     </p>

         <p>ANSWER: #1. I'm not <em>that</em> adventurous with my food- no bugs
           for me! I have been to each of those places though! I don't smoke
           cigarettes but I, uh, found out I do in Thailand. I did meet the lead
           singer of E!E when he came out to drink with the crowd. E!E (pronounced
           "eh-eh") is the Czech/Slovakian equivalent of Bad Religion- it was a
           GREAT show and we were the only Americans there.
