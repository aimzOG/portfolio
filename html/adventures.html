      <p class="intro">“If I’m an advocate for anything, it’s to move. As far as you can,
        as
        much as you can. Across the
        ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else’s shoes or at least eat
        their food. It’s a plus for
        everybody.”</p>

          <h3>Thailand</h3>
          <p>This country is a truly beautiful place. It was my first time out of the US
            as
            an adult! My boyfriend and I
            stayed in hostels and enjoyed night markets, beaches, temples, and my favorite
            part- seeing the elephants. I
            learned a lot about myself, about my relationship and how to not take things
            at
            home for granted. The people
            are so respectful regardless about their feelings toward you and I was blown
            away by the peacefulness of the
            Thai. To have only been there for even just two weeks was a blessing. </p>

          <h3>Europe</h3>
          <p>In Europe, we visited Berlin, Prague, Vienna, and Frankfurt. We saw the
            Danube
            River, were awestruck by
            graffiti art, and fell in love with the architecture. In Prague, we had the
            <em>coolest</em> experience- it
            was so authentic. We met a local who took us to a festival where we got to
            watch
            two bands that paved the way
            for punk rock in what was formerly Czechoslovakia! In the last picture is us
            with the lead singer from E!E
            (Eh-Eh).</p>

          <h3>Random</h3>
          <p>My friends and I enjoy going to the San Juan Islands and at least one other
            place each year.
            I believe you have to make time for a variety of things in life though! Fun
            fact, before skydiving I had not a
            nervous bone in my body- I just jumped. The view was magical. Laughter is a
            wonderful source of happiness and
            Tom Segura delivers those every time. Disneyland is really the happiest place
            on
            earth. The best advice? Get
            there as soon as it opens, stay till it closes, eat few churros, lunch at the
            Blue Lagoon, and buy some ears!

          <h3>Food</h3>
          <p>My heart belongs on a plate- it’s the one true way I know how to love my
            people! I enjoy bringing them
            together with a homemade dinner- Everybody needs to eat so might as well make
            an
            event out of it, right? I try
            to cook with fresh ingredients and go so far as to make my own sauces, grind
            my
            own meat, and use healthier
            substitutes if available.</p>
          <p>Pasta is my favorite dish to make from scratch. I finally perfected the
            ravioli
            (center). I tasted my first
            ever Eggs Benedict after I made it (top right). I had never tried one before
            and
            was inspired by a Masterchef
            challenge. It turned out delicious- crab and sweet potato bread makes all the
            difference. I really enjoy the
            challenge of some dishes and the freedom there is to make them your own.</p>
