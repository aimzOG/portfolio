    <h3>In My Career</h3>
    <p>My first job was at the age of 18 at the YMCA working with children. I
      thought I was going to be a teacher- it wasn't for me. I crossed over into
      the restaurant world working as host and server at three restaurants over
      the next 3 years. That too wasn't for me. Once I began working as an office
      at Heptio, a tech start-up, I finally began to excell. At 25 my career is
      still being made and I am ecstatic to continue growing.

    <h3>As a Student</h3>
    <p>My time at Heptio has lead me down to the path of project managemnet and
      coding.I began classes at Edmonds Community College (EdCC) for a project
      management certificate in summer 2018. I will recieve my certificate in
      March 2019. As of January 2019, I am in the front-end web development
      certificate program at University of Washington (UW). I am ecstatic to
      continue this journey and see where it leads me.</p>
