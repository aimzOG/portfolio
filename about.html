    <h3>As a Student</h3>
    <p>My time at Heptio has lead me down to the path of project managemnet and coding.
      I began classes at Edmonds Community College (EdCC) for a project management certificate
      in summer 2018. I will recieve my certificate in March 2019. As of
      January 2019, I am in the front-end web development certificate program
      at University of Washington (UW). I am ecstatic to continue this journey
      and see where it leads me.</p>
